					<p>
						Learn Node.js with a group in a casual environment! Node School Fort Worth is a monthly meetup to help people learn Node,
						JavaScript and other programming languages. Each meetup will focus on a
						<a href="https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers">workshopper</a> from Node School. Our FTW mentors will be teaching and
						available to help out through-out each class. Whether you're just starting out or have been developing for years, our
						workshops can help you learn something new or strengthen your knowledge!

					<p>
						<h4>Here at Node FTW, we want everyone to have a great time learning. The below guildeines will be enforced to keep the
							peace during each meetup.</h4>
						<br /> We, the organizers of NodeSchool Los Angeles, are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
						regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size,
						race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants
						violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizers of NodeSchool
						Los Angeles. Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression,
						sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate
						intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
						events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
						for any events at NodeSchool Los Angeles meetups or in any related communication channels. Community members asked
						to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the
						anti-harassment policy. If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of NodeSchool Los Angeles
						may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are
						being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.
